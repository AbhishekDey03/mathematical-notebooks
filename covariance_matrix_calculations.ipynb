    "For images of $150\\times 150$, we have a covariance matrix $\\Sigma = 22500 \\times 22500$. This is computationally expensive, as the matrix has $506,250,000$ entries. Our matrix is sampled from a normal distribution $\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)$ for $\\sigma = \\frac{5.4}{2\\sqrt{2\\log(2)}}$. This means that, given the entries we pass into the distribution (distances) are strictly positive, we can calculate confidences $\\alpha$ such that:\n",

When this is translatd to $(\\text{RA},\\delta)$ norm, it will have to be handled with a direct mask"
